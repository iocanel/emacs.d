# My emacs configuration

This is the set of files I am using to configure my emacs.
I started fresh a couple of months ago after my 3rd bankruptcy so, I tried to keep it as minimal as possible.

The setup is heavily influnced by doom (in fact I use prety much the doom early init script as is).

# Usage

   git clone git@github.com:iocanel/emacs.d.git
   cp emacs.d/* ~/.emacs.d
